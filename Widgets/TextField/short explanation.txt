1. Purpose of TextField

The TextField widget in Flutter is used to take user input (like name, email, password, etc.).

It allows typing text inside the app and can be styled or customized.



2. Important Properties
🔹 decoration

Controls the look and feel of the text field.

Inside decoration, we often use InputDecoration.

🔹 InputDecoration Options

labelText → A small label shown above the field (e.g., "Enter your name").

hintText → Placeholder text inside the box before typing (e.g., "Type here...").

border → Defines the shape of the box (e.g., OutlineInputBorder).

prefixIcon → Adds an icon inside the field (e.g., person icon before text).

🔹 keyboardType

Decides which keyboard type will open.

Example:

TextInputType.text → Normal typing

TextInputType.number → Number keypad

TextInputType.emailAddress → Email keyboard

🔹 obscureText

Used to hide characters (e.g., when entering a password).

true → hides input (shows ●●●● instead).

false → shows normal text.



3. Use Cases

Login forms → username, password.

Search bars → take user search input.

Registration forms → collect name, email, phone, etc.
