1. What are Named Routes?

A named route is like giving each screen a unique name (string identifier).

Instead of writing the full MaterialPageRoute every time, you just call the route name.

It makes navigation cleaner and easier, especially in apps with many screens.



2. Why Use Named Routes?

Keeps code short and organized.

Centralized place (inside MaterialApp) where all routes are defined.

Makes it easier to change or add new routes.

Useful when your app has more than 2-3 screens.



3. How Named Routes Work (Conceptually)

Define Routes: You create a routes map inside MaterialApp. Each screen gets a unique name.

Navigate with Name: Instead of pushing a widget, you just call the route name.

Go Back: Use Navigator.pop(context) as usual.



4. Example Flow

Define routes like:

"/" → Home Page

"/details" → Details Page

Navigate using:

Navigator.pushNamed(context, "/details");

Return using:

Navigator.pop(context);



5. Advantages of Named Routes

Readable: "/details" is clearer than a long MaterialPageRoute.

Centralized: All routes defined in one place → easier maintenance.

Scalable: Perfect for medium-to-large apps with many screens.

Supports Arguments: You can still pass data using route arguments.



6. Real-Life Analogy

Think of routes as street names in a city:

Instead of saying "Go north 200 meters, then turn right…" (like push with MaterialPageRoute),

You just say "Go to Main Street" (named route).
