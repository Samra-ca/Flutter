1. What is Push / Pop?

Push: Means navigating forward to a new screen.

Pop: Means going back to the previous screen.

Flutter uses a stack structure (like a pile of plates). Each screen is a "plate."



2. How the Stack Works

Imagine you have a stack of pages.

When you push, a new page is placed on top.

When you pop, the top page is removed, and you see the one below.



3. Push (Go Forward to New Screen)

When you push, you tell Flutter:
“Take me to another screen and show it.”

The previous screen stays in memory, underneath the new one.

Example use: Going from Home → Details Page.



4. Pop (Go Back to Previous Screen)

When you pop, you remove the current screen from the top of the stack.

This brings you back to the screen below it.

Example use: From Details Page → Back to Home.



5. Real-Life Analogy

Think of your phone’s browser history:

When you open a new link → Push (new page added on top).

When you press back → Pop (last page removed, go back).



6. Why Use Push/Pop?

It’s the simplest way to navigate between pages.

Perfect for small apps or when you just need to move forward/backward.
