ðŸ”¹ What is a Switch?

A Switch is a widget in Flutter that allows the user to toggle between two states:

ON (true)

OFF (false)

Itâ€™s mostly used for settings and preferences like enabling notifications, Wi-Fi, or dark mode.



ðŸ”¹ Key Properties of Switch

value

A boolean (true/false) that defines the current state of the switch.

Example: true â†’ ON, false â†’ OFF.

onChanged

A callback function that triggers whenever the user toggles the switch.

It gives the new boolean value (true/false).

Colors (Optional)

activeColor: The color of the switch when itâ€™s ON.

inactiveThumbColor: The color of the thumb when itâ€™s OFF.



ðŸ”¹ How it Works

The Switch displays according to the value.

If value = true â†’ Switch is ON.

If value = false â†’ Switch is OFF.

When the user taps it, the onChanged function is called with the new value.

You usually wrap it in setState (inside StatefulWidget) to update the UI instantly.

Wi-Fi ON/OFF toggle in mobile settings.

Dark mode ON/OFF switch in apps.
