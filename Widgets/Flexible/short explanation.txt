ðŸ”¹ What is Flexible?

The Flexible widget in Flutter is used inside Row, Column, or Flex to control how a child widget should resize within the available space.
Unlike Expanded, it allows the child to take only the space it needs (or shrink/expand) instead of forcing it to fill all available space.



ðŸ”¹ Why Use Flexible?

To give children room to adjust without stretching unnecessarily.

To make UI responsive but not always full-sized.

To prevent overflow issues in Rows/Columns.



ðŸ”¹ How Flexible Works

It adjusts its child proportionally using the flex property.

If fit: FlexFit.loose â†’ child takes only needed space (default).

If fit: FlexFit.tight â†’ child behaves like Expanded (fills space).



ðŸ”¹ Key Properties

child â†’ The widget to be resized flexibly.

flex â†’ Shares space ratio with other Flexible/Expanded widgets.

fit â†’ Controls how the child fills space:

FlexFit.loose â†’ takes minimum space.

FlexFit.tight â†’ takes maximum space (like Expanded).



ðŸ”¹ Example Use Cases

Making some widgets resize flexibly while others remain fixed.

Allowing text or images to shrink without overflowing.

Giving more priority to one child while keeping others smaller.
