ðŸ”¹ What is State Preservation?

State preservation means keeping the data, UI state, and user interactions intact even when:

A widget is rebuilt (due to hot reload, orientation change, etc.)

A user navigates between pages and comes back

The app is minimized or backgrounded

Without state preservation, your widgets will reset each time they rebuild.



ðŸ”¹ Types of State in Flutter

Ephemeral State (short-lived)

Belongs to a single widget

Example: Checkbox tick, TextField input while typing

Handled using setState

App State (long-lived / global)

Shared across multiple widgets/screens

Example: User login info, shopping cart, theme, settings

Handled using state management solutions like Provider, Riverpod, Bloc, etc.



ðŸ”¹ Common State Preservation Techniques
1. setState (Basic State Preservation)

For simple UI updates within a widget.

Does not preserve state if the widget is disposed.

2. AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin

Used inside widgets like PageView or BottomNavigationBar where Flutter disposes off-screen pages.

Ensures pages donâ€™t reset when switching tabs.

3. Restoration APIs (Restorable Properties)

Flutterâ€™s built-in way to preserve state when app is killed or resumed.

Example: Restoring text input after app restart.

4. State Management Solutions

Tools like Provider, Riverpod, Bloc, GetX help preserve and share state across widgets and routes.



ðŸ”¹ Why is State Preservation Important?

Prevents loss of user data

Provides smooth user experience

Makes apps feel fast and responsive (no need to reload everything)
