1. What is Center?

Center is a layout widget in Flutter.

It places its child exactly in the middle of the available space (both vertically and horizontally).



2. Why use Center?

To make a widget appear in the center of the screen or inside a parent container.

Helps create balanced and visually appealing layouts without manually adjusting padding or alignment.



3. Key Properties

child → The widget you want to center (can be Text, Icon, Image, Row, Column, etc.).

No other mandatory properties — simple and lightweight.



4. How it Works

Wrap any widget inside Center.

The widget automatically moves to the exact center of its parent.

Can also be used inside other layout widgets like Column or Row to center specific elements.



5. When to Use

To center single widgets on the screen (text, icon, button).

To simplify layout instead of manually using padding or alignment.
