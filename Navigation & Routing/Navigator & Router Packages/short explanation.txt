1. Why Navigator 2.0?

Navigator 1.0 is simple but limited (stack-based with push/pop).

Navigator 2.0 was introduced to support complex navigation flows, like:

Deep linking (open app directly to a specific screen).

Web-like navigation (forward/back in browser).

Dynamic routing (routes change based on app state, like login/logout).



2. Key Concepts in Navigator 2.0

Pages instead of Routes

In Navigator 2.0, navigation is declarative.

You define a list of pages and Flutter figures out how to update the UI.

RouterDelegate

Decides which screens (pages) should be shown.

Listens to app state and updates the navigator accordingly.

RouteInformationParser

Converts route info (like /home, /profile/123) into a data model.

Helps support deep linking.

Back Button Handling

Navigator 2.0 gives you full control over system back button or browser back.



3. Router Packages (Simplifying Navigator 2.0)

Writing pure Navigator 2.0 can be boilerplate-heavy, so packages make it easier:

✅ go_router (most popular)

Declarative and simple.

Handles deep links and redirection out of the box.

Good for most apps.

✅ auto_route

Powerful package for code generation.

Lets you define routes in one place → auto generates navigation code.

Great for large projects.

✅ beamer

Inspired by the “router outlet” concept.

Strong support for web navigation & nested navigation.



4. When to Use Navigator 2.0?

Your app needs deep linking (like /products/45).

You’re building a web app with browser-like navigation.

You want more control over navigation stack.

Large apps with complex state-based navigation.
