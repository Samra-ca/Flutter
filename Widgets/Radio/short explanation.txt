1. What is Radio?

The Radio widget in Flutter is used to select one option from a group of options.

Unlike Checkbox (which allows multiple selections), Radio works in a group, so only one can be selected at a time.



2. Important Properties
ðŸ”¹ value

Represents the value of this specific radio option.

Example: "Option 1"

ðŸ”¹ groupValue

The currently selected value for the whole group of radios.

If groupValue matches this Radioâ€™s value, then this radio will appear selected.

ðŸ”¹ onChanged

A function that runs when the user taps on the radio.

Updates the groupValue to the new value.

Usually wrapped with setState() inside a StatefulWidget.



3. How It Works Step by Step

Each Radio has its own value.

All radios in the same group share a common groupValue.

Flutter checks:

If value == groupValue, that radio is selected.

Otherwise, itâ€™s unselected.

When tapped, onChanged updates the state, setting groupValue = value.



4. Example Use Case

Gender Selection: Male / Female / Other â†’ Only one can be chosen.

Payment Method: Cash / Card / Online â†’ Only one can be active at a time.
