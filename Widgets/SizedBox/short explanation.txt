1. What is SizedBox?

A layout widget in Flutter used to create fixed space or fixed-size boxes.

Can be used with or without a child widget.



2. Why use SizedBox?

To add spacing between widgets in a Column, Row, or other layouts.

To control the size of a child widget explicitly.

Keeps the layout clean and readable.



3. Key Properties

height → vertical space or fixed height for child.

width → horizontal space or fixed width for child.

child → optional widget inside the SizedBox, which will adopt the given width and height.



4. How it Works

Without child → acts as empty space.

With child → forces the child to the specified width and height.



5. When to Use

Between widgets to add vertical or horizontal gaps.

To set a fixed size for a button, image, or text.

Useful in both Row and Column layouts.
