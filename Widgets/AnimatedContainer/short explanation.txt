ðŸ”¹ What is AnimatedContainer?

The AnimatedContainer is a special container in Flutter that automatically animates changes to its properties (like size, color, padding, margin, border, etc.) over a given duration.



ðŸ”¹ Key Properties

duration â†’ Time for the animation (e.g., Duration(seconds: 1)).

curve â†’ Defines the animation style (e.g., Curves.easeInOut).

Other container properties â†’ width, height, color, alignment, decoration (these can change and animate).



ðŸ”¹ How it Works

Wrap your widget inside an AnimatedContainer.

Change one or more properties inside setState().

Flutter smoothly animates the difference between the old and new values.



ðŸ”¹ Use Case

Animating UI changes without explicitly using AnimationController.

Smooth transitions for theme changes, buttons, cards, or layout adjustments.

Creating subtle effects like growing/shrinking boxes, color fade, or rounded corners transition.
